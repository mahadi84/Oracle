/*
--MOVE THE FILE datafile.dat TO /u01/app/oracle
1- Conventional Load  --sqlldr pdb1_admin/mahadi123@pdb1 TABLE=emp_x DIRECT=YES
2- Direct Path Load (faster) --sqlldr pdb1_admin/mahadi123@pdb1 TABLE=emp_x DIRECT=NO
3- Express mode --sqlldr pdb1_admin/mahadi123@pdb1 TABLE=emp_x
*/

/*--Conventional Load
Uses COMMIT
Always generates redo entries
Enforces all constraints
Fires INSERT triggers
Can load into clustered tables
Allows other users to modify tables during load operation
The insertion of an array ofrecords is followed by a COMMIT operation. 
Each data load may involve several transactions.
*/

/* --Direct Path Load (DIRECT=TRUE)
Uses data saves (faster operation)
Generates redo only under specific conditions
Enforces only PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, and NOT NULL
Does not fire INSERT triggers
Does not load into clusters
Prevents other users from making changes to tables during load operation
*/


--Express mode
/*
The main benefit of SQL*Loader express mode is the savings for time and effort that
results from NOT NEDDING to write and test a SQL*Loader CONTROL FILE. Instead, you specify
a single SQL*Loader command with a few parameters and the load starts. 

Another benefit of express mode is that it will try to use the fastest mechanism for loading
data files: external tables using parallel inserts with the append hint. The append hint on
an insert statement tells the database to use direct path for loading table data. Executing
the insert in parallel means that multiple processes can load data from the data file at
once, reducing the elapsed time for the load.

WITH CREATING control file in SERVER
====================================

--MOVE THE FILE EMPLOYEES.csv TO /u01/app/oracle
--we need to create a file called control file .ctl ( example EMPLOYEES.ctl )
--write the below commant into EMPLOYEES.ctl.
/*
Load Data
INFILE '/u01/app/oracle/EMPLOYEES.csv'
APPEND
INTO Table emp_x
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' 
(empid,
name,
gender,
deptno,
address
)
*/

--create a table (ex: emp_x)
--sqlldr control=/u01/app/oracle/EMPLOYEES.ctl log=/u01/app/oracle/EMPLOYEES.log
select * from emp_x
