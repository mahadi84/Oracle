***Let us do some transactions in pluggable database orclpdb Then we restore that backup

----Restore (CONTAINER DB) the backup-----
RUN

RESTORE DATABASE;
RECOVER DATABASE;
ALTER DATABASE OPEN;
}

----Restore (PLUGGABLE DATABASE) the backup----
RUN 
{
RESTORE PLUGGABLE DATABASE orclpdb;
RECOVER PLUGGABLE DATABASE orclpdb;
ALTER PLUGGABLE DATABASE orclpdb open;
}


--POINT-IN-TIME recovery of CONTAINER database

select TO_CHAR(sysdate,'DD-MON-YYYY HH24:MI:SS') from dual;

RUN
