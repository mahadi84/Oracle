01.What is Procedure and Sequence in Oracle Programming? Procedure vs User Define Function(UDF)?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ans: 
    PROCEDURE: Is a group of PL/SQL statements that you can call by name.
    SEQUENCE: An object in Oracle that is used to generate a (unique)number sequence, specially to act as a primary key.

Procedure vs User Define Function(UDF):
---------------------------------------
 > We cannot use Procudure in SQL statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, and JOIN CLAUSE. but we can use them with UDF.
 > We can use transactions in SP but it is not possible in UDF.
 > Procedure compiled Execution whereas UDF is Pre-compiled Execution.
 > SP can have both table variables and temporary tables but UDF can have only table variables as it does not permit the use of temporary tables.


02.What/Why is PL/SQL?
----------------------
Ans: 
    --PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions of SQL. Introduces block structure.
    --Oracle created PL/SQL that extends some limitations of SQL 


BASIC STRUCTURE:
----------------
[DECLARE]
   Declaration statements;
BEGIN
   Execution statements;
  [EXCEPTION]
      Exception handling statements;
END;
------

VARIBLE DECLARATION:
--------------------
DECLARE
  v_user_name user_info.user_name%TYPE;
  hire_date := to_date('19700101','YYYYMMDD');   /to assign a value or a variable to another use :=
  ERR_MESS varchar2(200);
BEGIN
  SELECT user_name INTO v_user_name
  FROM user_info
  WHERE user_id = :CONTROL.USERNAME;  // To receive data from FORM for query
  /* To show data to FORM's field*/
  :ERR_MESS:=v_user_name;
END;




PL/SQL IF THEN statement:
-------------------------
IF condition_1 THEN
  statements_1
     
     ELSIF condition_2 THEN
     statements_2
     ELSIF condition_3 THEN
     statements_3
ELSE
    else_statements
END IF;
