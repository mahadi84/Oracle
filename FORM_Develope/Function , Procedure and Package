What are PL/SQL functions in Oracle Database?
---------------------------------------------
In Oracle Database we can define a PL/SQL function as a self-contained sub-program that is meant to do some specific well defined task. 
Functions are named PL/SQL block which means they can be stored into the database as a database object and can be reused. 
That is also the reason why some books refer to PL/SQL functions as stored functions.

Types of PL/SQL functions in Oracle Database
--------------------------------------------
There are two types of PL/SQL functions in Oracle Database, these are
Pass-by-Value Functions and
Pass-by-Reference functions

FUNCTION SYNTEX:
----------------
--Function Header
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION circle_area (radius NUMBER) 
RETURN NUMBER IS
--Declare a constant and a variable
pi  	CONSTANT NUMBER(7,2) :=	3.141;
area 	NUMBER(7,2);
BEGIN
  --Area of Circle pi*r*r;
  area := pi * (radius * radius);
  RETURN area; 
END;


WHAT IS STORED PROCEDURE?
=========================
Tut: http://www.rebellionrider.com/how-to-create-pl-sql-stored-procedures-without-parameters-in-oracle-database/

Similar to PL/SQL Functions a stored Procedure is a self-contained subprogram that is meant to do some specific tasks.
Also similar to functions, procedures are named PL/SQL blocks thus they can be reused because they are stored into the database as a database object.
But unlike PL/SQL functions a stored procedure does not return any value. 

Syntax of PL/SQL Stored Procedures
----------------------------------
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE emp_sal
(dep_id NUMBER, sal_raise NUMBER) 
IS
BEGIN
  	UPDATE employees 
SET salary = salary * sal_raise 
WHERE department_id = dep_id;  
DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('salary updated successfully');
END;

Calling  Procedure:
-------------------
EXECUTE emp_sal(40,2);

02. What are the contents included in a package?

---------------------------
01. What/Why are PL/SQL Packages?
---------------------------------
-Packages are logical groups(libraries) of related PL/SQL objects under one name.
-Permanently stored into the database schema.
-Can be referenced or reused by your program.


02. What are the contents included in a package?
------------------------------------------------
A package can hold multiple database objects such as
 > Stored Procedures
 > PL/SQL Functions
 > Database Cursors
 > Type declarations as well as
 > Variables

**All the objects included into a package are collectively called Package Elements.

03. Package Architecture:
-------------------------
PL/SQL package is divided into two parts:
  > The Package Specification, also known as the Header and
  > The Package Body
  
Syntax of the package body:
---------------------------
CREATE OR REPALCE PACKAGE BODY pkg_name IS
	Variable declaration;
	Type Declaration;
BEGIN
	Implementation of the package elements…
END [pkg_name];
