==========================================================

01. What/Why are PL/SQL Packages?
---------------------------------
-Packages are logical groups(libraries) of related PL/SQL objects under one name.
-Permanently stored into the database schema.
-Can be referenced or reused by your program.


02. What are the contents included in a package?
------------------------------------------------
A package can hold multiple database objects such as
 > Stored Procedures
 > PL/SQL Functions
 > Database Cursors
 > Type declarations as well as
 > Variables

**All the objects included into a package are collectively called Package Elements.

03. Package Architecture:
-------------------------
PL/SQL package is divided into two parts:
  > The Package Specification, also known as the Header and
  > The Package Body
  
Syntax of the package body:
---------------------------
CREATE OR REPALCE PACKAGE BODY pkg_name IS
	Variable declaration;
	Type Declaration;
BEGIN
	Implementation of the package elementsâ€¦
END [pkg_name];
