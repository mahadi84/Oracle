01. What are PL/SQL Packages in Oracle Database?
------------------------------------------------
Packages are stored libraries in the database which allow us to group related PL/SQL objects under one name. 
Or in simple words, Packages are logical groups of related PL/SQL objects.
Packages are named PL/SQL Blocks which mean they are permanently stored into the database schema and can be referenced or reused by your program.

02. Definition of PL/SQL Packages:
----------------------------------
Packages are stored libraries in the database which allow us to group related PL/SQL objects under one name.

03. What are the contents included in a package?
------------------------------------------------
A package can hold multiple database objects such as
 > Stored Procedures
 > PL/SQL Functions
 > Database Cursors
 > Type declarations as well as
 > Variables

**All the objects included into a package are collectively called Package Elements.

04. Package Architecture:
-------------------------
PL/SQL package is divided into two parts:
  > The Package Specification, also known as the Header and
  > The Package Body
  
Syntax of the package body:
---------------------------
CREATE OR REPALCE PACKAGE BODY pkg_name IS
	Variable declaration;
	Type Declaration;
BEGIN
	Implementation of the package elementsâ€¦
END [pkg_name];
