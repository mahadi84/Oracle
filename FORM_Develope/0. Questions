01. What is a Record  and its type in datatype?
------------------------------------------------
A record is a group of related data items stored in fields, each with its own name and datatype. The fields correspond to table columns. 

Types of Record datatype
-------------------------
In Oracle PL/SQL we have three types of Record datatype.
 A) Table Based Record        
          Syntex: Variable_ name   table_name%ROWTYPE;
 B) Cursor Based Record, and   
          Syntex:    
          CURSOR cur_RebellionRider IS
          SELECT first_name, salary FROM employees WHERE employee_id > 200; 
          var_emp   cur_RebellionRider%ROWTYPE;
 C) User Defined Record.       
         Syntex:
         TYPE rv_dept IS RECORD(f_name  VARCHAR2(20), d_name  departments.department_name%type);
         var1 rv_dept;
