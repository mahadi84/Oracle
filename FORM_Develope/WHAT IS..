What is Oracle WebLogic used for?
It's an application server being developed by Oracle (even if it was originally a product of BEA, which was acquisited by Oracle - now 
it's so long since then that we can say it's really Oracle product).

Oracle WebLogic Server is a unified and extensible platform for developing, deploying and running enterprise applications, such as Java, for on-premises and in the cloud.
WebLogic Server offers a robust, mature, and scalable implementation of Java Enterprise Edition (EE) and Jakarta EE.

What is the difference between Oracle application server and WebLogic?
Unlike Oracle Application Server 10g, Oracle WebLogic Server separates the tasks of installing and configuring your environment. In Oracle Application Server 10g, 
you use Oracle Universal Installer to install and configure your Oracle Application Server environment, including the OC4J instances within that environment.
