WHAT IS ORACLE FROMS BUILDER?
-----------------------------
- Programs that guide the developer in performing common tasks(buit-in sub-program and trigger)
  Example: Creating

01. DATA BLOCK WIZARD (Developer corresponds to a table in the database.
                       For each table displayed on the form, a new data block will be created).
02. LAYOURT WIZARD  (Developer arranging the base table and columns on the form).


>>>Why does the leading zero of a number disappear Ex: First ZERO number of mobile phone?
Ans:---
Simple answer is, You cannot!!
Leading zeros has no value in a numeric data type. 
If you want to show then you need to convert the numeric data type to character using TO_CHAR.


>>>ORA-01439: column to be modified must be empty to change datatype/constraint?
Ans:--
Only WAY:
   01. Suspend constraints
   02. Create another column with varchar2 type
   03. Copy from number column to the new varchar2 column
   04. Delete number column
   05. Rename nvarchar column to the old one
   06. Rebuild indexes
   07. Activate constraints.
   
  OR you could use VIRTUAL COLUMN.


>>>ORA-02296: cannot enable (PUBALI.) - null values found
02296. 00000 - "cannot enable (%s.%s) - null values found"
-It happen basically because you have null values for this column. check the table's column.

Solution:
---------
1) Fix the problem updating the null values to a value (or a dummy value).
2) Use NOVALIDATE clause, like:
alter table TABLE_TEST modify COLUMN_TEST not null NOVALIDATE;

Is a good practice to set a default value for this column too.
It’s a probability that some kind of behavior (even a bug) on application is causing the null values, so, setting a default value, you avoid “new errors” on application layer.
Otherside, if you want to show where the bug is occouring, maybe is better to not set it

Ans: 
alter table employee_info drop column emp_mobile;
alter table employee_info rename column e_mobile to emp_mobile;

>>>> How to validate Name and Father's name can not be same.
Ans: IF :EI.name = :EI.f_name THEN

>>>> How to validate duplicate data from table 
Ans: create a procedure with sql: 
     select count(*) into v where user_name= :EI.mobile.

>> How to validate 18 or heigher age as DOB for employee.
Ans: tranc(date)= return round date value in number, 
     add_months(date/sysdate, NoOfMonth)= add month(no of day) with provided date

>>>> ERROR: FRM-40401: No changes to save. 
( it is not an error at all, this is the default functionality of the Forms, 
If there are no any changes made and you try to commit. 
It shows the message.)

Soln:--
01. 
CUSTOMIZE the Message:---
Trigger:ON-MESSAGE
declare
msgnum number := message_code;
begin
IF msgnum = 40401 THEN 
Message('my own message.'); 
end if;
end;

02.
HIDE the message:--
Trigger:Pre-Form (form level trigger) OR SYSTEM message-level,
:SYSTEM.MESSAGE_LEVEL := 5;

03.
AVOID the message:--
Use the Forms_DDL('COMMIT');

04.
Use "standard.commit" instead of "commit".
this bypasses any checking and does just that which you asked - commit, now!! 

>>>>>>>> Forms builder running very slow.
Ans: Normally its happen when u r connected to Windows domain (wht I experienced) 
if u disconnect ur lan and start the forms builder 10g & re-connect the lan. 
after these two steps u 'll get much much better results.
-OPEN the form builders with ADMIN PRIVELEGE.


>>>>PLS-00049: bad bind variable 'NEW.DOB' 
    -Table it doesn't contain a column 'NEW.DOB'

>>>>HOW to insert/select date into/from table throudh Oracle Developer?
   --insert into tem values(to_date('2015-01-01', 'yy-mm-dd'));
   --select to_char(datecol, 'YYYY-MM-DD')

>>>> Validate to not insert duplicate data like MOBILE NO.?
    --Normally this should be done with a unique constraint, not with triggers.

>>>> Validate age must be 18?
    --Trigger in TABLE-- 
      IF ADD_MONTHS(:NEW.EMP_DOB,216) > TRUNC(SYSDATE)    THEN
      RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20002,'Employee is under 18!');
      END IF;
    --TRUNC date defaults to beginning of day, so TRUNC(SYSDATE) is today 00:00:00.
      And 216 months is 18 x 12. So DOB + 216 months is date when person turns 18. 
      And if that is > TRUNC(SYSDATE) then person is not yet 18 years old.

>>>> How to create UNIQUE/PRIMARY KEY/COMPOSITE KEY constraint(অবরোধ) in a COLUMN?
   --UNIQUE KEY/PRIMARY KEY- A unique constraint is a single field or combination of fields that uniquely defines a record. 
   --PRIMARY KEY- When multiple fields are used as a primary key, they are called a COMPOSITE KEY.
   NOTE:
     In Oracle, a unique/PRIMARY KEY constraint can not contain more than 32 columns.
     A unique/PRIMARY KEY constraint can be defined in either a CREATE TABLE statement or an ALTER TABLE statement.
     -Oracle DOES NOT PERMIT you to create both a primary key and unique constraint with the THE SAME COLUMNS.
     
    PRIMARY KEY VS UNIQUE KEY
    - PRIMARY KEY, Cannot accept NULL values.
    - PRIMARY KEY, Only one primary key in a table.
    - PRIMARY KEY, A Primary key supports auto increment value.
    - PRIMARY KEY, We cannot change or delete values stored in primary keys.
    
   CODE:
   ALTER TABLE supplier
   ADD/DROP/ENABLE/DISABLE CONSTRAINT supplier_name_unique 
   UNIQUE/PRIMARY KEY(supplier_id, supplier_name, supplier_mobile);

>>>> How to force user to insert salary between 1000 to 2000 only or all charecter in uppder case?
    -A CHECK constraint allows you to specify a condition on each row in a table.
      CODE:
      ALTER TABLE suppliers
      ADD/DROP/ENABLE/DISABLE CONSTRAINT check_supplier_name
      CHECK (supplier_id BETWEEN 100 and 9999);
      CHECK (supplier_name = upper(supplier_name));
