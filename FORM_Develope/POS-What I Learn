--Let's not talk about solutions until we understand the problem.
--It is impossible to give a working solution to a problem I don't know.


WHAT IS ORACLE FROMS BUILDER?
-----------------------------
- Programs that guide the developer in performing common tasks(buit-in sub-program and trigger)
  Example: Creating

01. DATA BLOCK WIZARD (Developer corresponds to a table in the database).
02. LAYOURT WIZARD    (Developer arranging the base table's columns on the form).


--------------COMMON FUNCTIONs-----------------

clear_form(NO_VALIDATE, COMMIT, NO_COMMIT, NO_VALIDATE);
clear_block();


commit;
commit_form;
forms_ddl('commit');

next_item;
next_record;

go_item('item_name');
go_block('block_name');

show_lov('lov_name');
show_alert('alert_name');

call_form('form_name');
open_form('form_name');
new_form();

LTRIM(RTRIM(:ITEM));

set_alert_property('alert_name', TITLE, 'DELETE');
set_alert_property('alert_name', ALERT_MESSAGE_TEXT, 'Are you sure?');

set_item_property(item_name, enabled, property_false)
get_item_property(item_name, enabled);

set_window_property('window_name', window_state, maximize);

message('Field is empty');
raise form_trigger_failure;

:system.form_status='CHANGED';


----------------FORMS RELATED------------------------

01. How many ways are there creating a form? Advantage and Disadvantage?
     -Automaticaly with DataBlock (Create table first and Next,Next,Next)
     -Fully Manual(Drag and Drop)
     -Programatically (Create table, Procedure and Create a DataBlock next,choose and next)
02. Shortcut key for:
    >Layout Editor(Canvas) >Propertise Platte > Group/Ungroup
    >LOV data show

03. How to create:
    >Dynamic LOV >Select Item >Check Box
    >Radio Group

04. What would be the FONT SIZE, FIELD HEIGHT?
    - Default: Font Size: 9, Field Height: 16

05. What is the difference between LOV and LIST item?
    -A list item can have only ONE COLUMN, 
    -Whereas LOV can have ONE or MORE columns. 
     (To show LOV: F9 is used for 6i..for 9i and 10g you need to use control L)



---------------Validation & TIGGERs------------

01. Should I validate form data twice? -One for item trigger -One before insert/Update?
02. Name all tigger that we can user to validate a field.
03. How to validate(And show MSG to fill up the form)
    >LOV Data >Check Box >Radio Group >Mobile number >Email Address
04. How to Show validation error message with Alert
    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52396085/show-the-error-message-in-a-popup-alert-rather-then-on-status-bar
    BEGIN
    IF( Condition )THEN
        --Show the error as popup alert message box
        MESSAGE('This is an error.');
        MESSAGE('');
        RAISE FORM_TRIGGER_FAILURE;
    END IF;
END;

TRIGGERs:
---------
FORM Level:----
WHEN-NEW-FORM-INSTANCE     (Use:like Global varible pass form to form Ex: :uname := :global.aa)

BLOCK Level:-----
PRE-INSERT                 (Ex: select nvl(max(u_id,1000)+1 into :id from pubali.emp_info;)

ITEM Level:-----
KEY-NEXT-ITEM             (Ex: validate if item value is NULL)
WHEN-BUTTON-PRESSED


>>>> How to validate Name and Father's name can not be same From FORM ITEM?
Ans: IF :EI.name = :EI.f_name THEN

>>>> How to validate duplicate data(Ex: Mobile No) from FORM/TABLE 
Ans: create a procedure with sql: 
     select count(*) into v where user_name= :EI.mobile.
     --FOR-TABLE: Normally this should be done with a unique constraint, NOT with triggers.


>>>> Validate age must be 18+?
    --Trigger in TABLE-- 
      IF ADD_MONTHS(:NEW.EMP_DOB,216) > TRUNC(SYSDATE)    THEN
      RAISE_APPLICATION_ERROR(-20002,'Employee is under 18!');
      END IF;
    --TRUNC date defaults to beginning of day, so TRUNC(SYSDATE) is today 00:00:00.
      And 216 months is 18 x 12. So DOB + 216 months is date when person turns 18. 
      And if that is > TRUNC(SYSDATE) then person is not yet 18 years old.



--------------------TABLE-------------------------

>>>> TABLE NAME was very difficult to choose like 
      - product_category(meaningfull, but Exceed 15chr)
      - pos_product_category(with software name, very meaningfull, easy to understand, but Exceed 15chr)
      - pos_prod_cate (Not exceed 15char, but not much meaningfull)

>>>> I made Most of the Fields in the table NOT NULL, is it ok?

>>>> How to create UNIQUE/PRIMARY KEY/COMPOSITE KEY constraint(অবরোধ) in a COLUMN?
   --UNIQUE KEY/PRIMARY KEY- A unique constraint is a single field or combination of fields that uniquely defines a record. 
   --PRIMARY KEY- When multiple fields are used as a primary key, they are called a COMPOSITE KEY.
   NOTE:
     In Oracle, a unique/PRIMARY KEY constraint can not contain more than 32 columns.
     A unique/PRIMARY KEY constraint can be defined in either a CREATE TABLE statement or an ALTER TABLE statement.
     -Oracle DOES NOT PERMIT you to create both a primary key and unique constraint with the THE SAME COLUMNS.
     -CONSTRAINT Name MUST be unique in ALL TABLE
     
    PRIMARY KEY VS UNIQUE KEY
    - PRIMARY KEY, Cannot accept NULL values.
    - PRIMARY KEY, Only one primary key in a table.
    - PRIMARY KEY, A Primary key supports auto increment value.
    - PRIMARY KEY, We cannot change or delete values stored in primary keys.
    
   CODE:
   ALTER TABLE supplier
   ADD/DROP/ENABLE/DISABLE CONSTRAINT supplier_name_unique 
   UNIQUE/PRIMARY KEY(supplier_id, supplier_name, supplier_mobile);

      

>>>> How to force user to insert salary between 1000 to 2000 only or all charecter in uppder case?
    -A CHECK constraint allows you to specify a condition on each row in a table.
      CODE:
      ALTER TABLE suppliers
      ADD/DROP/ENABLE/DISABLE CONSTRAINT check_supplier_name
      CHECK (supplier_id BETWEEN 100 and 9999);
      CHECK (supplier_name = upper(supplier_name));


>>>> How to RENAME existing TABLE name.
      - alter table pubali.subject rename to sub;

>>>> How to delete/rename a column of a table.
     - alter table employee_info drop column emp_mobile;
     - alter table employee_info rename column e_mobile to emp_mobile;


>>>> Adding and Deleting new column into a existing (empty/non-empty) table and alter default/not null value as well.
>>>  ORA-01439: column to be modified must be empty to change datatype/constraint?
      - alter table pubali.pos_user_info add user_full_name varchar2(50) not null;
      - alter table pubali.pos_user_info drop column user_full_name;
      - ALTER TABLE pubali.pos_user_info modify  user_status varchar2(3) default 'N';
   -Solution for NON-EMPTY TABLE:
   Only WAY:
   01. Suspend constraints
   02. Create another column with varchar2 type
   03. Copy from number column to the new varchar2 column
   04. Delete number column
   05. Rename nvarchar column to the old one
   06. Rebuild indexes
   07. Activate constraints.
   
  OR you could use VIRTUAL COLUMN.


>>>> UNABLE to INSERT DATA into the TABLE.
      - INSERT INTO does not work with form that is created by DATABLOCK.    

>>> Why does the leading zero of a number disappear Ex: First ZERO number of mobile phone?
    Ans:---
    Simple answer is, You cannot!!
    Leading zeros has no value in a numeric data type. 
    If you want to show then you need to convert the numeric data type to character using TO_CHAR.


>>> ORA-02296: cannot enable (PUBALI.) - null values found
    02296. 00000 - "cannot enable (%s.%s) - null values found"
   -It happen basically because you have null values for this column. check the table's column.

    Solution:
    ---------
    1) Fix the problem updating the null values to a value (or a dummy value).
    2) Use NOVALIDATE clause, like:
    alter table TABLE_TEST modify COLUMN_TEST not null NOVALIDATE;

    Is a good practice to set a default value for this column too.
    It’s a probability that some kind of behavior (even a bug) on application is causing the null values, 
    so, setting a default value, you avoid “new errors” on application layer.
    Otherside, if you want to show where the bug is occouring, maybe is better to not set it
