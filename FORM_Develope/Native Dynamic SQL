===========================
01.How to check TABLE or OBJECT is created or NOT?
---------------------------------------------------
DESCRIBE tut_83; Or DESC tut_83
OR
SELECT 'We created a table with name '||object_name||' in ' ||owner||' schema on '||created
FROM all_objects WHERE object_name ='TUT_83';


02. What is Static SQL?
------------------------
As the name suggests any SQL statement which does not change during the runtime is called a static SQL statement.
The advantage of Static SQL statements is that we already know whether all the depended objects over which we are writing the statement are present or not. 
Another advantage of Static SQL statements is that we hardcode them into our application. Thus we can tune them for optimal performance.


03. What is Native Dynamic SQL?
-------------------------------
Again as the name suggests, any SQL statement which is constructed at the runtime is called dynamic SQL. 
These statements are built on the fly. Therefore they cannot be hardcoded into the application.
This in turn increases their flexibility.

On one hand static SQL lets you execute only DML statements inside your PL/SQL block. 
On the other hand the dynamic SQL enables you to execute DDL statements and that too inside your PL/SQL block. 
Thus by using Dynamic SQL you can create a table or drop an index or truncate your table right inside your PL/SQL block. 
This is an advantage of Native Dynamic SQL over static SQL.

04. What is Native Dynamic PL/SQL?
------------------------------
Similar to dynamic SQL, the process of constructing PL/SQL code at runtime is called dynamic PL/SQL.


05. Benefits of Native Dynamic SQL
------------------------------
Easy to Use Codes: 
Improvement In The Performance Of The Code: 
Support for User-Defined Types: 
Support For Fetching Into Records: 

06. What are the functionalities of Dynamic SQL in Oracle Database?
---------------------------------------------------------------
Firstly, Dynamic DDL & DML with the use of any bind variable.
Secondly, Dynamic DQL and
Thirdly, Dynamic DML using a known list of bind variables
These are the three functionalities which Dynamic SQL adds to your PL/SQL programming.

06. how do we use dynamic SQL in Oracle Database?
-------------------------------------------------
The two most common methods of using dynamic SQL and PL/SQL in Oracle Database are:
 01. Execute Immediate statement and
 02. Open-For, Fetch & Close block.

Execute Immediate statement is used when the query is returning single row data. 
In case the query is returning multi row data then you can take help of Open-For,Fetch and close block. 
We will learn about Execute Immediate and Open-for, fetch and close block in detail in the upcoming tutorials.

07. Are there any other ways of using Dynamic SQL in Oracle Database?
------------------------------------------------------------------
Apart from above mentioned most commonly used methods,
the other ways of using dynamic SQL or PL/SQL are
 01. With Bulk Fetch
 02. Secondly with Bulk Execute Immediate
 03. Along with Bulk FORALL and
 04. Lastly with Bulk Collect Into statement


08. How To Use Execute Immediate With INTO:
==========================================
 http://www.rebellionrider.com/how-to-use-execute-immediate-with-into-clause-in-oracle-database/

Execute Immediate With INTO Clause
Native dynamic SQL or NDS is helping developers by providing flexibility, improving performance and simplifying programming syntaxes. 


09. So what is an Execute Immediate Statement in Oracle Database?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Using Execute Immediate we can parse and execute any SQL statement or a PL/SQL block dynamically in Oracle Database. And by dynamically I mean at runtime.
Execute immediate takes only one argument. It can either be a SQL statement or a PL/SQL block. 
Compiler treats the arguments of the Execute Immediate statement as the string of VARCHAR2 data types. 
Therefore do make sure to enclose your SQL query or PL/SQL block into the pair of single quotes ( ‘ ’ ).

10. Can we use any SQL statement with Execute Immediate?
----------------------------------------------------
Any SQL statement or PL/SQL block which returns single row of results can be used with Execute Immediate. 
Furthermore if your statement returns more than one row of results then there are other ways. 
Additionally these we will discuss in future tutorials.


Example of Execute Immediate using the first clause which is INTO.
------------------------------------------------------------------
**Execute Immediate with INTO clause.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    sql_qry     VARCHAR2 (150);
    emp_tot     NUMBER(3);
BEGIN
    
    sql_qry:= ‘SELECT count (*) FROM employees';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_qry INTO emp_tot;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Total employees are: '||emp_tot);

END;
/

11. How To Run Create Table DDL With EXECUTE IMMEDIATE?
======================================================
http://www.rebellionrider.com/how-to-run-create-table-ddl-with-execute-immediate-in-oracle-database/


12. what is the proper way of executing a DDL through PL/SQL program?
-----------------------------------------------------------------
You can execute a DDL through PL/SQL program either by using DBMS_SQL package or by using the Execute Immediate statement of Native Dynamic SQL. 
The latter option is the most used one, specially now a days because of its better performance and easy to learn syntax.

DDL for creating a table first:
-------------------------------
CREATE TABLE tut_82 (
    tut_num    NUMBER (3),
    tut_name   VARCHAR2 (50)
    );
    
DDL through PL/SQL program using Execute Immediate:
---------------------------------------------------
BEGIN
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'CREATE TABLE tut_82(
                	tut_num     NUMBER(3),
                	tut_name    VARCHAR2(50)
                )';
END;

--OR

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    ddl_qry     VARCHAR2 (150);
BEGIN
    ddl_qry := 'CREATE TABLE tut_82(
                tut_num     NUMBER(3),
                tut_name    VARCHAR2(50)
                )';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ddl_qry;
END;


13. How to ALTER & DROP Table DDL With Execute Immediate?
=======================================================
http://www.rebellionrider.com/alter-drop-table-ddl-with-execute-immediate-in-oracle-database/

Example of ALTER:
------------------
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
 ddl_qry VARCHAR2(50);
BEGIN
 ddl_qry := 'ALTER TABLE tut_83
        	 ADD  tut_date DATE';
 EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ddl_qry;
END;

Example of DROP:
------------------
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    ddl_qry     VARCHAR2 (100);
BEGIN
    ddl_qry := 'DROP TABLE tut_83';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ddl_qry;
END;
/


14. How to Insert DML With Bind Variable: USING Clause Of Execute Immediate Statement?
======================================================================================

15. What is a bind variable?
----------------------------
We can define bind variable as the variable that we create in SQL*Plus and then reference in PL/SQL. Furthermore we can declare a Bind variable anywhere in the host environment. 
Therefore bind variables are also known as host variable.

INSERT DATA INTO TABLE WITH EXECUTE IMMEDIATE STATEMENT:
--------------------------------------------------------
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    sql_smt VARCHAR2 (150);
BEGIN
    sql_smt :=  'INSERT INTO stu_info (student_name) VALUES (:stu_name)';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_smt USING 'Steve';
END;
