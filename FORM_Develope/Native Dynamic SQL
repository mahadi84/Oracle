01.How to check TABLE or OBJECT is created or NOT?
---------------------------------------------------
DESCRIBE tbl_name; Or DESC tbl_name;
OR
SELECT 'We created a table with name '||object_name||' in ' ||owner||' schema on '||created
FROM all_objects WHERE object_name ='TUT_83';


02. What is Static Vs Native Dynamic SQL?
-----------------------------------------
-Any SQL statement which does not change during the runtime is called a static SQL statement.
-We hardcode them into our application.
-Static SQL lets you execute only DML statements inside your PL/SQL block. 
Example, the application may allow users to enter their own queries.
 
 DYNAMIC:
 - Any SQL statement which is constructed at the runtime is called dynamic SQL. 
 - These statements are built on the fly. Therefore they cannot be hardcoded into the application.
 - Dynamic SQL enables you to execute DDL statements and that too inside your PL/SQL block.
    You can create a table or drop an index or truncate your table right inside your PL/SQL block. 
    This is an advantage of Native Dynamic SQL over static SQL.


03. How do we use dynamic SQL in Oracle Database?
-------------------------------------------------
Common methods of using dynamic SQL and PL/SQL:
 01. Execute Immediate statement and
 02. Open-For, Fetch & Close block.

The other ways of using dynamic SQL or PL/SQL are
 01. Bulk Fetch
 02. Bulk Execute Immediate
 03. Bulk FORALL and
 04. Bulk Collect Into statement


How To Use Execute Immediate With INTO:
=======================================

04. Example of Execute Immediate using the first clause which is INTO.
------------------------------------------------------------------
**Execute Immediate with INTO clause.
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    sql_qry     VARCHAR2 (150);
    emp_tot     NUMBER(3);
BEGIN    
    sql_qry:= â€˜SELECT count (*) FROM employees';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_qry INTO emp_tot;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Total employees are: '||emp_tot);
END;


How To Run Create Table DDL With EXECUTE IMMEDIATE?
======================================================

05. Example of DDL through PL/SQL program using Execute Immediate:
---------------------------------------------------
BEGIN
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'CREATE TABLE tut_82(
                	tut_num     NUMBER(3),
                	tut_name    VARCHAR2(50)
                )';
END;

--OR

SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    ddl_qry     VARCHAR2 (150);
BEGIN
    ddl_qry := 'CREATE TABLE tut_82(
                tut_num     NUMBER(3),
                tut_name    VARCHAR2(50)
                )';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ddl_qry;
END;


06. How to ALTER & DROP Table DDL With Execute Immediate?
=======================================================
http://www.rebellionrider.com/alter-drop-table-ddl-with-execute-immediate-in-oracle-database/

Example of ALTER:
------------------
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
 ddl_qry VARCHAR2(50);
BEGIN
 ddl_qry := 'ALTER TABLE tut_83
        	 ADD  tut_date DATE';
 EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ddl_qry;
END;

Example of DROP:
------------------
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    ddl_qry     VARCHAR2 (100);
BEGIN
    ddl_qry := 'DROP TABLE tut_83';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ddl_qry;
END;

How to Insert DML With Bind Variable: USING Clause Of Execute Immediate Statement?

07. What is a bind variable?
----------------------------
We can define bind variable as the variable that we create in SQL*Plus and then reference in PL/SQL. Furthermore we can declare a Bind variable anywhere in the host environment. 
Therefore bind variables are also known as host variable.


08. Example of INSERT DATA INTO TABLE WITH EXECUTE IMMEDIATE STATEMENT:
--------------------------------------------------------
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
    sql_smt VARCHAR2 (150);
BEGIN
    sql_smt :=  'INSERT INTO stu_info (student_name) VALUES (:stu_name)';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE sql_smt USING 'Steve';
END;
