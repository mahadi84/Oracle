What are PL/SQL Collections in Oracle Database?
-----------------------------------------------
In simple language we can say that, an array in Oracle Database is called Collection.
A homogeneous single dimension data structure which is made up of elements of same datatype is called collection in Oracle Database.


Types of PL/SQL Collections in Oracle Database
----------------------------------------------
PL/SQL collections can be divided into two categories:
 A) Persistent -which physically store the collection structure with the data into the database and can be accessed again if needed
 B) Non-persistent -non-persistent collection only stores data and structure for one session.

In the basis of above categories collections are further divided into three types:
 01. Nested Tables
 02. Variable Sized Arrays or VARRAYs and
 03. Associative arrays.

01. Nested Table
----------------
Nested tables are persistent collection which means they can be stored into the database and can be reused. 
Nested tables has no upper limits on rows thus they are unbounded collections.
Nested tables are initially dense but can become sparse through deletion.
Example:----
SET SERVEROUTPUT ON;
DECLARE
   TYPE my_nested_table   IS TABLE OF number;
    var_nt  my_nested_table :=  my_nested_table (9,18,27,36,45,54,63,72,81,90);
BEGIN
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Value Stored at index 1 in NT is ' ||var_nt (1)); 
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE ('Value Stored at index 2 in NT is ' ||var_nt (5));
END;

01.1>How To Create Nested Table As Database Object?
---------------------------------------------------
http://www.rebellionrider.com/how-to-create-nested-table-as-database-object-in-oracle/

Example:-------
CREATE TABLE my_subject(
	  sub_id    	NUMBER,
	  sub_name  	VARCHAR2 (20),
	  sub_schedule_day    my_nested_table
) NESTED TABLE sub_schedule_day STORE AS nested_tab_space;

update a single instance of nested table:----
UPDATE TABLE
  (SELECT sub_schedule_day FROM my_subject 
  WHERE sub_id = 101) A
SET A.COLUMN_VALUE   = 'Thur' 
WHERE A.COLUMN_VALUE = 'Sat';

01.2> How To Create Nested Table Using User-Define Datatype?
------------------------------------------------------------
http://www.rebellionrider.com/how-to-create-nested-table-using-user-define-datatype-in-oracle-database/

Example:-----
CREATE TABLE Base_Table(
   tab_id  NUMBER,
   tab_ele My_NT
)NESTED TABLE tab_ele STORE AS stor_tab_1;
 /
 INSERT INTO base_table (tab_id, tab_ele) VALUES
 (801,  -- value for 1st colum 
   My_NT (object_type (1,'Superman') -- values for 2nd column )
 );
 /
 UPDATE base_table SET tab_ele = My_NT(object_type(1,'SpiderMan')) WHERE tab_id = 801; 
 /
 Select tab_id, tab_ele FROM base_table;
 /SELECT * FROM TABLE(
  SELECT tab_ele FROM Base_Table WHERE tab_id = 801
)

02. VARRAYs
-----------

Similar to Nested tables Variable-Sized Arrays are also persistent collections thus they can be created in database as well as PL/SQL block and can be reused.  
But unlike nested tables VARRAYs are Bounded, can hold only a fixed amount of elements.
Syntex: 
CREATE [OR REPLACE] TYPE type_name
IS {VARRAY | VARYING ARRAY} (size_limit) OF element_type;
Example:
--------
DECLARE
    vry_obj dbObj_vry    := dbObj_vry();
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1..vry_obj.LIMIT
    LOOP
        vry_obj.EXTEND; 
        vry_obj(i):= 10*i;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(vry_obj(i));    
    END LOOP;
END;
/


03. Associative Array  
---------------------
Unlike nested table and VARRAYs, associative arrays are non-persistent collections thus they cannot be stored into the database.
Since they cannot be store hence they cannot be reused but they are available in PL/SQL block for the session. 
But similar to nested tables associative arrays are unbounded, don’t have lower and upper limits on rows.







Commonly used terms in PL/SQL Collection.
Bounded & Unbounded Collection – A collection which has lower or upper limits on values of row number or say a collection 
which can hold only limited number of elements are called bounded collections. 
A collection which has no lower or upper limits on row numbers are called unbounded collections.

Dense & Sparse Collection. – Collections is said to be dense if all the rows between the first and the last are defined and given a value. 
And a collection in which rows are not defined and populated sequentially are called sparse collection.
