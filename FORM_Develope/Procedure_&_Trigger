01.What is Procedure and Sequence in Oracle Programming? Procedure vs User Define Function(UDF)?
================================================================================================
Ans: 
    PROCEDURE: Is a group of PL/SQL statements that you can call by name.
    SEQUENCE: An object in Oracle that is used to generate a (unique)number sequence, specially to act as a primary key.

Procedure vs User Define Function(UDF):
---------------------------------------
 > We cannot use Procudure in SQL statements like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE, and JOIN CLAUSE. but we can use them with UDF.
 > We can use transactions in SP but it is not possible in UDF.
 > Procedure compiled Execution whereas UDF is Pre-compiled Execution.
 > SP can have both table variables and temporary tables but UDF can have only table variables as it does not permit the use of temporary tables.


02.What/Why is PL/SQL?
======================
Ans: 
    --PL/SQL stands for Procedural Language extensions of SQL. Introduces block structure.
    --Oracle created PL/SQL that extends some limitations of SQL 


03. What/Why is Trigger? Where/How it works?
--------------------------------------------
We can also say that they are specialized stored programs which execute implicitly(পরোক্ষভাবে) when a triggering event occurs.
This means we cannot call and execute them directly instead they only get triggered by events in the database.

Why/Adv. trigger?
-----------------
We can--
01. -Enforce business rules that can’t be defined by using integrity constants.
02. -Gain strong control over the security.
03. -Collect statistical information on the table access.
04. -Generate values for derived columns such as auto increment numeric primary key.
05. -Prevent the invalid transactions Using database triggers.


These events can be anything such as:
-------------------------------------
1. A DML Statement – An Update, Insert or Delete statement executing on any table of your database. 
                      You can program your trigger to execute either BEFORE or AFTER executing your DML statement.
2. A DDL Statement – Such as CREATE or ALTER. 
                      These triggers can also be executed either BEFORE or AFTER the execution of your DDL statement. 
                      These triggers are generally used by DBAs for auditing purpose (keep an eye on the various changes on your schema).
3. A system event. – I mean shut down or startup of your database.
4. A User Events   – Such as log off or log on onto your database. You can create a trigger which will either execute before or after the event. 
                      Furthermore, it will record the information such as time of event occur, the username who created it.


04.Restriction on The Database Triggers:
=========================================
-> The maximum size of the database trigger body must not exceed 32,760 bytes. This is because triggers’ bodies are stored in LONG datatypes columns.
-> A trigger may not issue transaction control statements or TCL statements such as COMMIT, ROLLBACK or SAVEPOINT. All operations performed when the trigger fires, become part of a transaction. Therefore whenever this transaction is rolled back or committed it leads to the respective rolling back or committing of the operations performed. 
-> Any function or procedure called by a database trigger may not issue a transactional control statement. That is unless it contains an autonomous transaction.
-> Declaring LONG or LONG RAW variable is not permissible in the body of the trigger.


05. How to check ERROR of a TRIGGER:
====================================
SHOW ERRORS TRIGGER trigger_name;   //Check Error
select * from user_errors where   type = 'TRIGGER' and  name = 'TRIG_NAME';   //Check syntax error in a trigger:


06. How to Audit(who insert/update/delete row in) Table Using DML Triggers?

                        CUST_NAME VARCHAR2(50);

==============================================================
Tut: http://www.rebellionrider.com/how-to-create-synchronized-table-backup-using-dml-trigger-in-oracle-pl-sql/

**NO GOOD for those tables that involve heavy data input, deletion and updation due to the performance reasons.

CREATE TABLE superheroes_backup AS SELECT * FROM superheroes WHERE 1=2;
--
CREATE OR REPLACE trigger superheroes_backup
BEFORE INSERT OR DELETE OR UPDATE ON superheroes
FOR EACH ROW
ENABLE

DECLARE

BEGIN

AFTER DDL ON SCHEMA
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO schema_audit VALUES (
sysdate, 
sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_USER'), 
ora_dict_obj_type, 
ora_dict_obj_name, 
ora_sysevent);
END;

Audit to Database
-----------------
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER db_audit_tr 
AFTER DDL ON DATABASE
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO schema_audit VALUES (
sysdate, 
sys_context('USERENV','CURRENT_USER'), 
ora_dict_obj_type, 
ora_dict_obj_name, 
ora_sysevent);
END;



09. What/Why INSTEAD-OF Trigger? How to create Instead-Of INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE Trigger?
=======================================================================================

Instead-of triggers in oracle database provide a way of modifying ONLY VIEWS(NOT TABLE) that cannot be modified directly through the DML statements. 
By using Instead-of triggers, you can perform Insert, Update, Delete and Merge operations on a view in oracle database.

What are Modifiable and Non Modifiable Views?
---------------------------------------------
A view is naturally modifiable if you do not require INSTEAD OF triggers to insert, delete or update data as well as if it complies to the restrictions discussed 
herewith. If the view query comprises of any of the mentioned constructs, 
then it is not naturally modifiable and therefore you cannot perform inserts, updates, or deletes on the view:

Set operators
Aggregate functions
GROUP BY, CONNECT BY, or START WITH clauses
The DISTINCT operator
Joins (however, some join views are updatable)


INSTED OF INSERT Trigger
========================

Step1: Create Tables Table 1- trainer and Table 2- Subject
CREATE TABLE trainer ( full_name VARCHAR2(20));
CREATE TABLE subject( subject_name VARCHAR2(15) );
Insert dummy data into the above tables

INSERT INTO trainer VALUES ('Manish Sharma');
INSERT INTO subject VALUES ('Oracle');

Step 2: Create View that will show the combined result of the data from the two tables above.
CREATE VIEW vw_rebellionrider AS
SELECT full_name, subject_name FROM trainer, subject;

This is a non-updatable view which you can confirm by executing any DML statement over it. Error as a result of DML operation on this view will be your confirmation.

Step 3: Create INSTEAD OF Insert trigger over the view vw_rebellionrider that we created in step 2.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER tr_Io_Insert
INSTEAD OF INSERT ON vw_rebellionrider
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  INSERT INTO trainer (full_name) VALUES (:new.full_name);
  INSERT INTO subject (subject_name) VALUES (:new.subject_name);
END


Instead-Of UPDATE Trigger
-------------------------
Instead-of update trigger will override the default behavior of your update operation when you execute the update statement and will let you update the data of the underlying tables over which your view is created.

Example:
Tables (Trainer and Subject) and View (VW_RebellionRider) used in this example are the same as the ones we created in the previous tutorial.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER io_update
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON vw_rebellionrider
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE trainer SET FULL_NAME = :new.full_name 
  WHERE FULL_NAME = :old.full_name;
  UPDATE subject SET subject_NAME = :new.subject_name 
  WHERE subject_NAME = :old.subject_name;
END;
/

Instead-of DELETE trigger Example:
----------------------------------
In this example I will again use the View VW_RebellionRider which we created earlier and have consistently used in this Instead-of trigger series so far.

Needless to say that executing DELETE DML on this view will return an error because of its non-updatable nature. Thus the only way to perform DELETE DML on this view is by using an Instead of trigger. Let’s quickly create one.

CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER io_delete
INSTEAD OF DELETE ON vw_RebellionRider
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  DELETE FROM trainer WHERE FULL_NAME = :old.FULL_NAME;
  DELETE FROM subject WHERE SUBJECT_NAME= :old.SUBJECT_NAME;
END;
