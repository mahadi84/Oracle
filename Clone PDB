--login as oracle user and create folder
--mkdir /u01/app/oracle/oradata/ORCL/pdb5

--Alter into to orclpdb and do some uncommited tansactions.
--update hr.employees set salary=salary +1 where employee_id=100;
--select salary from hr.employees where employee_id=100; 

alter session set container=cdb$root;

CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb5 from orclpdb
FILE_NAME_CONVERT = ('/u01/app/oracle/oradata/ORCL/orclpdb/','/u01/app/oracle/oradata/ORCL/pdb5/');

/*
you can do this if you need oracle managed files to names the files
CREATE PLUGGABLE DATABASE pdb5 from orclpdb
create_file_dest '/u01/app/oracle/oradata/ORCL/pdb5'
*/
